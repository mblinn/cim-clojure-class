# cim-clojure-class

Project for an introductory Clojure class.

## Setup

I'll be using Eclipse and Counterclockwise, Eclipse's Clojure plugin, during the class.

Instructions on getting set up with Eclipse and Counterclockwise are here:

http://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/wiki/Documentation#Install\_Counterclockwise

You can also use your IDE/Editor of choice.

Getting started instructions for a variety of IDEs can be found here:

http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started

If you're using Eclipse and Counterclockwise, all you need to do once you've got this cloned is create a new Clojure project called 'cim-clojure-class' 
in the Eclipse workspace you've got it checked out to.  The plugin integrates with Clojure's build tool, Leinengen, to set up the classpath etc.
